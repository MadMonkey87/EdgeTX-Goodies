# EdgeTX-Goodies
Some widgets, themes and other scripts for EdgeTX

See the individual folders for details & instructions

Note: if a widget does not have a readme file that simply means this is a dedicated widget I made for myself for a dedicated purpose. Feel free to use them but don't expect it to work for you!
